# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately so we can address it promptly.

- Create a private security issue in this repository or use GitHub's security advisory flow.
- For urgent/critical issues, mention `@alsebaaest00-hue` in the private report.

We will triage security reports quickly and publish a security advisory when a fix is available.
